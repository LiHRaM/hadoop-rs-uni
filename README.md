# Hadoop-Rs - Programming Assignment


## Goals
There are five tasks in all.
I have modified the original tasks from the programming assignment to fit my datasets.

### Task 1
Study centrality metrics: degree centrality, PageRank centrality, k-core centrality.

### Task 2
Compute the most highly cited *paper* using degree centrality with focus on in-degrees, i.e. most influential paper.

### Task 3
Compute the most influential nodes using the PageRank algorithm.

### Task 4
Compute the most influential nodes using the k-core centrality metric.

### Task 5
Repeat tasks 2-4 with Apache Giraph.

## Overview
The project uses the Rust programming language to create mappers and reducers for Hadoop.
The Streaming tool provided by the Hadoop project is used to call the mappers and reducers (see more in `tools/hadoop.sh`).
This project uses a small dataset (5.6MB of edges) and a standalone installation of Hadoop.
Two datasets are used, the larger one from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-Patents.html and the smaller one from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-HepPh.html.
Both are citation networks.

### Accomplishments
I completed the first three tasks, i.e. studied centrality, and calculated InDegrees and PageRank for the datasets.

## Interesting Aspects

* **Debugging** - Debugging distributed applications is difficult. Finding out how the MapReduce framework works like Unix pipes helped isolate where things were going wrong.
* **Data Formatting** - In order to calculate the PageRank for the dataset, I needed to change its format. I was able to do this using a simple IdentityMapper + AppendReducer to quickly reformat the dataset into an adjacency matrix from an adjacency list.
* **Sorting and Shuffling** - The PageRank algorithm requires repetition until convergence, i.e. that certain steps be repeated until the output is stable. As far as I'm aware, it only does this for transfers from Mappers to Reducers, which means I can't just feed the output of one reducer into another.
